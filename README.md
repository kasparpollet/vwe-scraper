# vwe-scraper

Assignment to scrape fuel info of https://www.unitedconsumers.com/brandstofprijzen.

### Choices
- **Beautifulsoup**: No need to render js so I don't
- **Saving the HTML**: Only access website if new information is needed
- **Sys arguments**: This is a simple script, nice to specify what needs to happen in command line
- **One file**: Normally I never do this, but python is in one file because this is a very small script

### Questions
- Weather and where to clean data
- How the data should be saved (looking at dates)
